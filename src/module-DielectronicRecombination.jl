`module  JAC.DielectronicRecombination`  
... a submodel of JAC that contains all methods for computing dielectronic recombination strength & rate coefficients 
    for some given initial, intermediate and final-state multiplets. Special code has been implemented to account for 
    the capture into high-n Rydberg shells by incorporating, in addition to the explicitly calculated Auger and radiative
    rates, also several hyrogenic and empirical corrections to the DR resonance strength. Further corrections can be 
    readily added if the needs arise.
        
    The program distinguishes between the prior set-up of all pathways (i -- m -- f) as well as of passages (i --m).
    For passages, the radiative stabilization into any lower-lying level is calculated "on fly" by dividing the 
    possible final levels into two groups: (i) The explicitly calculated final levels with a principal quantum number
    n <= nFinal and (ii) a set of final levels with principal quantum numbers nFinal < n <= nHydrogenic < nLowestCaptured.
    See DielectronicRecombination.AbstractCorrections for possible hydrogenic, empirical and other corrections that 
    can be taken into account.
    
    Before any dielectronic-recombination calculations are done, it is generally suggested to carefully check the given
    lists of initial, intermediate and final configuration since missing levels in these lists are "hard" to detect 
    automatically.
