`module  JAC.DeepLearning`  
... a submodel of JAC that contains all methods for dealing with the training, test and use of neutral
    networks for atomic applications. This module distinguishes between different NN and associated 
    applications, whose details are compiled in the corresponding inc files.
    
    Each NN on atomic data/information is typically based on a particular AtomicModel which comprises
    a set of shells (subshells) and orbitals as well as a "recipi" how the atomic features are constructed/
    extracted from this information. This may include simplified atomic-structure computations.
    To extract the information from a (trained) NN, the particular requests are formulated & processes
    by an DeepLearning.Application(), which can be "preform"(ed) like other Computation's and Estimate's
    within the JAC toolbox.
